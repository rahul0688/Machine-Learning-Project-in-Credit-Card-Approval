# Machine-Learning-Project-in-Credit-Card-Approval
In this machine learning project, I built a predictive model to assess credit card approval likelihood based on applicant information and financial history. By analyzing a dataset containing historical credit card applications, I trained and evaluated various machine learning algorithms to predict credit card approval outcomes accurately.
